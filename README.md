## Main Features

### Oobabooga AI API Integration
Using an Oobabooga text generation webui API server, you can have AI chats! New characters can be added with `/addcharacter` by whitelisted members, and existing characters can be seen by anyone with `/getcharacter`. Start a conversation with one or more characters with the bot prefix (in my case, "[") and the character's name followed by a comma. For example, `[cleck how are you?` would ask the character named "cleck" how are you, and `[cloud,tarpan,southchinatiger lets go fishing!` would say lets go fishing to the three characters. 

### Translator
Translate messages with flag emojis! React to a message with the country's flag of the language you want, and it will translate the content into that language. To use DeepL, react with a :regional_indicator_d: emoji and then the flag you wish. Remove translation messages with an :x: emoji.

### Random Friend
Use randfr to get a random Friend from japari-library.com! Returns the Friend as a link.

### ReWords Points
ReWords rewards users for saying words and phrases correctly, or can punish them for certain phrases. For every 'good phrase' said correctly, you earn a point and 'bad phrases' lose a point. The phrases are configurable, and supports exact match checking (ex. if "HAV0X" is set as an exact match phrase, "hav0x" will not earn a point.)
